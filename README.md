# Cancer Detection Model

This project focuses on detecting cancerous tissue from histopathology images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with additional support for hyperparameter tuning via Keras Tuner.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and dataset handling
- Data visualization and analysis
- Multiple CNN architectures
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Training and evaluation with ROC AUC
- Test set prediction and CSV export

## Dataset
This project uses the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) from Kaggle.

## Setup
Setup for google colab. Change kaggle flag, paths and folder structure as needed.
